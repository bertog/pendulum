Polyrythmic pendulum visualization created with vanilla JS canvas work.
Sound from Vibraphones and Added particles background.
It swings hypnotic in space, looks like a chaos, some time in middle but syncing up after 8 minutes 20 seconds and repeats again.
Inspired by the jdm-project on YouTube(https://youtu.be/4GaGnU8Ij2Y), great help from Hyperplexed YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/@Hyperplexed).
